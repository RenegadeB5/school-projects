Goals: Make a program that simulates a horse race, using a "coin flip" to determine whether they move forward each turn.

Input: Number of your choice to seed the random number generator

Output: The race results each turn as well as the winner(s) when one is decided

Steps:

Define functions

Prototypes: void printTracks(array), void won(array)

In main function:
	Define a 5 item array. This will hold the number for how far in the track horses 1-5 are.
	Define run variable and set as true
	Ask input for random number
	Use that number to seed the generator
	While run is true:
		define win variable and set to false
		for each item of global array:
			generate random number between 0 and 1
			add the random number to the current track, since its only 0 or 1
			if track position number is 15:
				run is set to false and win variable is set to true
		if win variable is true, call won(array) function
		call printTracks(array) 

printTrack(track):
	grab track progress from array
	print a string of 14 "."'s, and insert (track parameter + 1) at the track value

won():
	iterate through all the tracks and announce the horse has won if it is at 15. (Will work with ties)
