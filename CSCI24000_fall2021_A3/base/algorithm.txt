Goals: Make a program that simulates a horse race, using a "coin flip" to determine whether they move forward each turn.

Input: Number of your choice to seed the random number generator

Output: The race results each turn as well as a winner when one is decided

Steps:

Prototypes: void printTracks(), void won()

Define a 5 item array. This will hold the number for how far in the track horses 1-5 are.

In main function:
	Define run variable and set as true
	Ask input for random number
	Use that number to seed the generator
	While run is true:
		define win variable and set to false
		for each item of global array:
			generate random number between 0 and 1
			add the random number to the current track, since its only 0 or 1
			if track position number is 15:
				run is set to false and win variable is set to true
		if win variable is true, call won function
		call printTracks() 

printTrack(track):
	find track value in array with track parameter
	print a string of 15 "."'s, and insert the (track parameter + 1) number at the track value

won():
	iterate through all the tracks and announce any horses at 15. (Will work with ties)
