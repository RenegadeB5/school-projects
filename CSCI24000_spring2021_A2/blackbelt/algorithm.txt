Goals: Write a program in c that will create a 9-item array with random numbers and then sort the elements of the array using pointers.
Input: An array of 9 integers
Output: The 9 integer array that has been sorted.
Steps:
Create and fill the array with random numbers. The seed will be the time.
Create the 3 functions being called in the provided code.
The 3 functions are printValues, sort, and swap.

printValues(): 
	define variable ints that will hold the final string to be printed
	iterate through the values variable and add the value to ints
	print ints

sort():
	iterate through values for a
		iterate through values for b
			if a > b, then swap a and b

swap(value a, value b):
	swap position of a and b in values
