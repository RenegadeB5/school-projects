Goals: Write a program in c that will sort the elements of an array using pointers.
Input: An array of 9 integers
Output: The 9 integer array that has been sorted.
Steps:
Create the 3 functions being called in the provided code.
The 3 functions are printValues, sort, and swap.

printValues(): 
	define variable ints that will hold the final string to be printed
	iterate through the values array and print each number

sort():
	iterate through values for a
		iterate through values for b
			if a > b, then swap a and b by passing them to the swap function as pointers

swap(value a, value b):
	put a in a temp variable
	set a equal to b
	set b equal to temp variable
