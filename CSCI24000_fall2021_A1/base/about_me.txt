Name: Duncan Barnes

Major: Computer Science

Prior Experience: I know a decent amount about javascript and node, I used to make a bunch of
discord bots. I spend more time on my laptop than I do my phone so my knowledge about computers is
above average.

I've always been a nerd growing up, especially when it came to computers, so when the time came around
to start thinking about what I want to do in the future, the answer was immediately clear. In nerd
words, I want to become a full stack developer.

My hobbies as of now include but are not limited to youtube and anime.
